# Features

## Sequence Analysis
* Sequence Alignment: Tools for aligning DNA, RNA, and protein sequences to identify regions of similarity. These tools support pairwise and multiple sequence alignments using algorithms such as Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman, and ClustalW.
* Motif Discovery: Utilities for discovering conserved motifs within sequences, which can indicate functional elements like transcription factor binding sites.
* Sequence Manipulation: Scripts for basic operations on sequences, including translation, reverse complement, and sequence extraction based on specified criteria.

## Genomics
* Genome Assembly: Scripts for assembling short reads into longer contiguous sequences (contigs) and scaffolds. Includes tools for error correction and quality assessment.
* Genome Annotation: Utilities for annotating genomic features such as genes, regulatory elements, and repeat regions. Includes integration with databases like NCBI and Ensembl.
* Variant Analysis: Tools for detecting and analyzing genetic variants (SNPs, indels) from sequencing data. Supports variant calling, filtering, and annotation.

## Proteomics
* Protein Structure Prediction: Tools for predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins based on their amino acid sequences. Includes homology modeling and ab initio prediction methods.
* Peptide Analysis: Utilities for analyzing peptide sequences, including cleavage prediction, peptide mass calculation, and peptide property prediction.
* Mass Spectrometry Data Processing: Scripts for processing mass spectrometry data, including peak detection, spectral matching, and quantification of peptides and proteins.

## Data Visualization
* Plotting Functions: Functions for creating various types of plots, including scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and sequence logos. These tools facilitate the visual exploration of biological data.
* Genome Browsers: Utilities for visualizing genomic data in the context of a genome browser, allowing for interactive exploration of genomic regions and annotations.
* 3D Structure Visualization: Tools for visualizing protein and nucleic acid structures in three dimensions, supporting formats like PDB and CIF.

## Statistical Analysis
* Statistical Tests: Implementations of common statistical tests used in bioinformatics, including t-tests, chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact test.
* Regression Analysis: Tools for performing linear and logistic regression analyses on biological data, helping to uncover relationships between variables.
* Survival Analysis: Utilities for conducting survival analysis, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards modeling, often used in clinical and genomic studies.

## Phylogenetics
* Tree Construction: Tools for constructing phylogenetic trees from sequence data using methods such as neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference.
* Tree Visualization: Utilities for visualizing and annotating phylogenetic trees, allowing for the exploration of evolutionary relationships.
* Comparative Genomics: Scripts for comparing genomes across different species to identify conserved and divergent regions, supporting studies on evolutionary biology.

## Data Integration
* Multi-Omics Integration: Scripts for integrating data from multiple omics layers (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to provide a comprehensive view of biological systems.
* Database Connectivity: Tools for connecting to and querying popular biological databases, including Ensembl, NCBI, and UniProt.

## Data Conversion
* Format Conversion: Scripts for converting between different bioinformatics file formats, such as FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, BED, VCF, and SAM/BAM.
* Data Normalization: Tools for normalizing biological data, addressing batch effects, and preparing data for downstream analysis.
* Annotation Conversion: Utilities for converting between different annotation formats and integrating annotations from multiple sources.
